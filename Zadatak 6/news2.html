            <h2>It is a global clubbing powerhouse in terms of the DJs, parties and festivals it books and has helped to spearhead the Croatian clubbing revolution over the last 10 years.</h2>

            <p>Papaya Club regularly features in the higher echelons of our poll and for good reason: it is a global clubbing powerhouse in terms of the DJs, parties and festivals it books and has helped to spearhead the Croatian clubbing revolution over the last 10 years.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It is of course home to one of the most notable events of the summer, Hideout festival, and is also well known and loved for hosting after-beach pool parties for six hours every day. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Those are always well attended, with on-point residents supplying the sounds as sun, seascapes, drinks and dancing make for a wild afternoon.  </p>
            <br>
            <p>There is also a restaurant, plus two pools, a VIP lounge area and regular sunset boat parties to enjoy.</p>
            <br>
            <p> The club turns 20 this year, so expect some extra special treats and surprises and a non-stop party atmosphere all season long.  </p>
