            <h2>Is there anything better than dancing on the sand, or overlooking the blue ocean? There is something very special about partying outdoors, and on the coast...</h2>

            <p>"Think it’s just about festivals in Croatia nowadays? Think again. Papaya, situated on Zrce Beach on the island of Pag, is a bona fide Croatian clubbing success story. Each summer season this open-air behemoth in a stunning setting hosts a series of one-off DJ headlined events.  Everyone from Jamie Jones, Sven Väth, Justice and Loco Dice to Hardwell, Nicky Romero and W&W have appeared here, ensuring the underground and more commercial sounds are equally well-represented. It is also the home of Hideout and the DJ Mag Beach Festival."  - quote by DJ MAG
